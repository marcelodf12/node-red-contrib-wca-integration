# Whatsapp Cloud Api Integration
## About
This node allows you to send messages directly using the official whatsapp cloud api.
For this you need to have a developer account, create a whatsapp application from the console and create a token.

For the configuration of the node, a token and an id of the sending phone are needed.

## TODO
Pending guide to generate the credentials in Facebook/Meta developer console.
